# Introduction

This is my **first Quarto document**. Quarto allows you to create documents in different formats like HTML, PDF, and even presentations.

## Section 1: Basic Syntax

You can write content using _Markdown_ syntax. For example:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- Lists and bullet points

### Code Example

Quarto also allows you to write and display code. Here's an example in Python:

```{python}
# A simple Python example
x = 5
y = 10
z = x + y
print("The sum is:", z)
